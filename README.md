## Issues:

-   Dashboard:

    -   Products state does not load
    -   Users state does not load
    -   Check by doing console.log() the data
    -   It shows error in Material Table - ```this.props is not a function```

-   Overall
    -   (DONE) Check the logged in user handler function as data of the user is present in `user.data` and not in ```user```




## Features to Add:
- Check if the user is admin user then display the dashboard option else do not display
    - This can be done by taking a state as ```isAdmin``` in the redux and checking it everytime dashboard is used.

- Add the menu page
- Add the About page
- Add the  Services Page
